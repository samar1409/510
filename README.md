# TECHIN 510 Final Project Description

## Project Objectives
- Develop an interactive real-time web application that integrates diverse urban data streams (traffic conditions, harsh weather, public transportation schedules) to assist commuters in making informed daily decisions.
- Clearly present real-time urban data to users, providing actionable commuting suggestions based on current environmental and transit conditions.
- Tailor recommendations based on user location and destination information, enabling personalized commuting solutions.

## Target Users and Needs
- **Daily Commuters**: Professionals and students in urban settings who regularly navigate city infrastructure.
  - Need timely and accessible information about current environmental conditions (weather, traffic, transportation).
  - Require proactive notifications regarding disruptions or delays in their daily commute.
  - Seek alternative commuting suggestions when disruptions or unfavorable conditions arise.

## Key Deliverables
- Interactive web application integrating multiple web APIs (traffic, weather, public transportation).
- Real-time visualizations of urban data conditions.
- Map-based visualization indicating active disruptions and recommended alternatives.
- Notification system allowing users to set preferences for alerts and updates.

## Special Constraints
- Compliance with data privacy regulations, specifically the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), regarding management and protection of user data.

## Expected Outcome
- Enhanced quality of life for users through improved daily decision-making, minimized commuting stress, and increased adaptability to urban disruptions.
